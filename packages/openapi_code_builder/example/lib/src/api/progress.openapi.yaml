      ## What is a Xube Account?

      An Account is generally associated with an organization. Accounts are used to manage your organization's Xube devices, user permissions, configurations, and data management.

      ## What a Xube Account is not

      In Xube, the concepts of Users and Accounts are different. In Xube, the concepts of an Account and a User are different. A User is an individual who can access areas of Accounts where they have permission to do so. Accounts are organizations that users create and manage based on their permission levels for the Account. Users can belong to multiple Accounts, and any user can create an Account.

    description: |-
      ## Account Creation and Identification

      Anyone can create a Xube account once they have signed up. Creating an account will automagically provide you with administrative privileges where you have full control to manage the account settings and permissions. Account must have at least one administrator at all times.

      ### Unique Account Names and IDs

      If your account name is already in use, Xube ensures uniqueness by adding a character (for example `your-account-name_<idx>`). This is known as your account id which is included in the response when creating an account via the Xube API. This is essential for all API interactions with Xube as it uniquely identifies your account for operations and support.

      ### Account Deletion Policy

      At the moment the ability to delete an account is not available, but it may be supported in the future if we get enough interest.

    description: |-
      ## Managing Account Users

      ### Adding and Removing Users

      To add a user to your account, an administrator or another user with the appropriate permissions needs to send an invite. Users can belong to multiple accounts if needed, which allows for flexible work across different teams, projects, or companies. Similarly, removing a user is straightforward and can be done by those with the right level of access. This helps keep your account secure and ensures only current team members have access.

      ### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

      In Xube, each user is assigned a specific role that defines what they can see and do within the account. At the moment there are several roles available:

      - **Administrators** have unrestricted access to all settings and data for the Account. They can add or remove users, adjust roles, configure settings, and access all data without restrictions. This role is typically reserved for team leaders or IT staff who need full oversight over the system's operation.
      - **Writers** are granted the ability to modify and update content within the system. They can add new entries, update existing data, and make changes as necessary, but they don't have access to manage user roles or change account-wide settings. This role is ideal for team members who need to contribute actively to projects but don't require control over system configurations.
      - **Readers** have view-only access, which allows them to see data and reports without the ability to make any changes. This role is suitable for stakeholders or team members who need to be informed about progress and metrics but do not participate in direct management of the content or settings.

      Each of these roles is designed to provide the necessary access based on the responsibilities of the user, ensuring that your system remains secure while promoting an efficient workflow.

      This system, known as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), is designed to ensure that users have precisely the access they need—nothing less, nothing more. It's a great way to minimize risk and keep things running smoothly.

    description: |-
      ### Configurable User Permissions

      Sometimes, predefined roles just don’t cut it when you need ultra-specific access controls. That's where Permissions come into play. In Xube, Permissions offer a fine-grained level of control, allowing you to tailor user capabilities directly to your needs.

      Administrators can manage the permissions of your users to ensure they align perfectly with your company’s policies. Whether it’s allowing a user to view specific datasets, modify device settings, or manage other users' access, Permissions can be adjusted to cover just about any action within the system.

      As an example, perhaps you would like to have a third party installer see details about the device health without being able to view other aspects of your Company's Xube configuration - just set the appropriate permissions and you're good to go.

      This flexibility not only enhances security by enforcing the principle of least privilege but also ensures that each team member has exactly the tools they need to be effective. You can view the Xube permissions references [here](https://xube.io)

    description: |-
      ## Accessing Your Accounts

      Understanding and managing your account affiliations is straightforward in the Xube system. Here’s how you can view and manage the accounts you're associated with:

      ### Viewing Your Accounts

      You can view which accounts you have access to with the [Get User Accounts API](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/User-accounts/operation/Get%20User%20Accounts). This view is private and only you can see the accounts that you have access to. It's a quick and easy way to keep track of your various roles and responsibilities across different projects or teams.

      ### Joining and Leaving Accounts

      **Leaving an Account:** If you decide that it's time to move on from a project or you no longer need access to an account, you can opt to leave the account. This action can be done through your account settings, ensuring that you maintain control over your participation in various accounts.

      **Joining an Account:** As for joining new accounts, there are two ways to go about it:

      - **Creating an Account:** If you’re starting a new project or initiative, you might want to create a new account. This gives you immediate administrator privileges, allowing you to set up the account exactly how you need.
      - **Receiving an Invitation:** Most users join additional accounts by invitation. Only existing members with the appropriate permissions can send invites, ensuring that new additions are authorized and intentional.

      Managing your account affiliations is designed to be as straightforward and secure as possible, giving you the flexibility to collaborate effectively while maintaining control over your access and involvement.
  - name: Data overview
    description: |-
      "Data" refers to the data collected from sensors by your Xube devices. This data is your data to manage. Xube does not persistently store this data. Data is simply collected from

      ## Metadata

      Xube collects metadata to monitor the health and usage of devices, to help provide a better service. For instance, if no data has been received for a significant period, Xube may issue a warning.

      ## Collecting acquired data from sensors

      Before data can be sent to you, Xube Devices need to be configured to collect data from sensors.

      Our empirical results show Xube Devices can be configured to acquire data at rates up to 100Hz with our sensors. However, this can change depending on the sensor. It's recommended to test a sensor that you're planning to use with different frequencies configured to determine the maximum achievable frequency.

      We are expanding this to multiples of KHz with our new set of edge products which will be available shortly. Get in touch with us for more information at help@xube.io

      For help configuring devices, or if higher data collection frequencies are required, the Xube team can assist - reach out to us at start@xube.io

      ## Sending data from devices

      The rate at which data is acquired from sensors is sent is configurable with a maximum frequency is once per second.

      The Xube team can help you to configure this at start@xube.io

      ## Receiving acquired data at your Destination

      In order to receive data acquired by sensors, you need to set a destination. See documentation on [Managing Destinations](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Data/Destinations) for more information.

      ## Reliability

      The Xube Devices, and Platform will do its best to forward your acquired data to your destination in near real time time, however there may be times where the data can not be delivered successfully. This is often (but not limited to) caused by the following reasons:

      - Poor connectivity
      - Wifi authentication issues
      - Port access / support at the internet service provider level (port 8883 must be allowed)
      - Unreliable of power source

      It is your responsibility to ensure that Xube devices have the necessary connectivity and power to operate. For more information see [Device Technical Specifications](https://xube.io/404)

      If you believe that there is an issue with a device you can troubleshoot it by using the [Devices APIs](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Devices). If you're stuck then feel free to reach out to us at help@xube.io.

      ### Replaying Data (Coming soon)

      You can activate a replay data option at a small extra fee. The Xube Platform holds your data temporarily so that if something goes wrong in the acceptance of your data, we can replay it to you. Data is held for a maximum of 30 days. After this the collected Data will no longer be able to be replayed to you.

      Note: that this will only work if the device is operating as expected and the data is being sent to the Xube Platform.

      ## Data format

      The format of the received data is:

      ```json
      {
          "v": 1, //Schema version - currently 1
          "m": [ //array containing all the metadata for the Data
              {
                  "m": { //Metadata for the first reading
                      {
                          "s": 1714303382, //Seconds since epoch when data was read
                          "us": 12345 //Additional microseconds when data was read
                      }
                  }
              }
          ],
          "s": 2 //Total bytes of each reading
      }
      ```

      This is then followed by a null character and the data in **_Binary_** format.

      Here is an example of 20 readings with the data in HEX format:

      ```json
      {
        "v": 1,
        "m": [
          { "m": { "us": 462285, "s": 1714303382 } },
          { "m": { "us": 568533, "s": 1714303382 } },

      ```

      ## Parsing your data

      In order to parse into single readings for processing and storage, it's recommended to follow these steps:

      1. Split the json and binary data at the null character that separates them. `\0` or `0x00` can be used
      2. Convert each `s` number of bytes to the reading value from Binary
      3. Match each of these values with the `nth` entry in `m` array in the json metadata

      This will allow you to manage your data as single readings.

      ### SDK parser (In Development)

      Shortly you will be able to use the tools in the [Xube Dev Kit](https://github.com/XubeLtd/dev-kit) to help you parse, and manage data sent to your destination.
  - name: Destinations
    description: |-
      Your Data Destination is where data acquired from devices gets sent. This Destination must able to handle the following:

      1. Accepting data acquired from Xube Devices
      2. Confirming that it is a valid Destination

      ## How data Destinations differ from other Xube subscriptions

      An Account Data Destination can only be set once per Xube Account, whereas most other subscriptions in the Xube Platform can be subscribed to multiple types.

      ## Subscribing to acquired Data

      Unlike other subscriptions, setting your Destination requires several steps so that Xube can ensure that you own the Destination and that it is ready to receive data.

      ### Before you start

      Before you subscribe to your Account's data, you need to ensure that your Destination is ready to receive it. The process is as follows:

      1. Send a subscription request with your desired Destination and headers
      2. A confirmation request will be sent to the Destination set in your subscription
      3. Confirm your Destination with the details sent in the confirmation request
      4. Data starts streaming to your Destination

      This is outlined in more detail below.

      ### Step 1 - Subscribe to your Account Data

      The process of subscribing to your data is similar to how [Xube Webhooks](https://api.jez.xube.dev/docs#tag/Events-and-notifications/Webhooks) work. Ensure your subscription request includes the following:

      - Your HTTPS Destination
      - Your Account id
      - Authentication any other Headers that you would like to be included when receiving data at your Destination

      ### Step 2 - Receive your Destination confirmation

      If it is the first time you've subscribed this Destination to your Account Data, you'll need to confirm that you own or have access to the Destination and that it's ready to accept data.

      To start this confirmation process, Xube sends your Destination a confirmation request with the following structure

      ```json
      {
        "account": "<Your account id>",
        "arn": "<An identifier that is associated with your Destination>",
        "confirmationToken": "<A token that you need to return so we know you've received it"
      }
      ```

      These details need to be sent back in your confirmation response as detailed next.

      ### Step 3 - Confirming your Destination

      The easiest way to confirm your Destination is with the [Xube Destination dev kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xube/kit-Destination).

      You can also manage this by identifying that a request to your Destination is a confirmation request and sending a response with the details from the confirmation request to the [Confirm Data Destination API](https://api.xube.io/docs/#tag/Destinations/operation/Confirm%20Destination)

      ### Step 4 - Data Streaming Starts

      Now that your Destination has been confirmed, it's time to accept your Data. This process is covered in the [Data overview](https://api.xube.io/docs/#tag/Data-overview)

      ## What happens if I miss my Destination Confirmation Request?

      Don't stress - there's a backup plan. If you miss the confirmation at your Destination, you can request to [resend the confirmation request](https://api.xube.io/docs/#tag/Destinations/operation/Resend%20Destination%20Confirmation).

      It's recommended to set your Destination up to automatically manage confirmation requests.

      ## Destination requirements and best practices

      Before you start the subscription process, please ensure that your Destination meets the requirements outlined below.

      ### Destinations Restrictions

      - Destinations must be an HTTPS url for security purposes
      - The same Destination cannot be used for multiple accounts
      - Only one Destination can be active for an Account at any time

      ### Securing your Data Destination

      In addition to using HTTPS, Destinations should be secured by requiring Authentication. Xube includes any headers that you set when subscribing a Destination to your Account Data.

      ### Other Recommendations

      - Your Destination could receive data at very high rates and therefore it's recommended that you provision for scale.
      - Use Xube tools like the [Xube kits](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40xube%2Fkit) to help with the ingestion of data and confirmation of Destinations.
  - name: Devices overview
    description: |-
      Xube devices are central to the platform, enabling the acquisition of real-world data from almost any type of sensor. These devices are designed to be user-friendly and versatile.

      ## Configuration

      Xube devices are designed to be configured by anyone, but requires and understanding of how the devices operate and some familiarity with the Xube Platform. It's recommended to reach out to the Xube team (start@xube.io) to help get you started.

      ## Physically connecting to sensors

      The standard Xube is equipped with generic IP67 rated connectors, however these can be changed to the connectors of your liking with the help of the Xube team. Xube also offers solutions for splitting into multiple connections if you'd like to read data from several sensors like junctions. To help figure out what you need, reach out to the Xube team at start@xube.io.

      ## Communicating with sensors

      In order for devices to communicate with a sensor, a driver is required. Users can create these drivers themselves, but it is recommended to have the Xube team get you started. Documentation on driver creation is coming soon.

      ## Connectivity

      Xube devices offer multiple ways to connect to the internet:

      - **Ethernet**: Provides a stable, wired connection.
      - **WiFi**: Offers a convenient wireless option.
      - **Cellular**: Allows for connectivity in remote areas.

      Devices will automatically fall back to the best connectivity method available to them based on their configuration. For example, if ethernet is set as the default connectivity method but it becomes unavailable then the device will attempt to connect via the next best, for example - WiFi. After some time, if ethernet becomes available again, the Device will reconnect via ethernet.

      Note: The Cellular connectivity provider is the responsibility of the Customer. We have preferred providers, but we do not offer any cellular connectivity services directly. The Devices accept Simcards which are owned by our customers.

      If the connectivity option that you need isn't supported yet, please contact help@xube.io.

      ## Power Options

      Xube devices support several power sources to ensure flexibility in various environments:

      - **Battery Only**: Suitable for mobile, low throughput, or temporary setups.
      - **USB Input (4 - 16V)**: Allows for easy power supply, and power banks to extend battery life via a USB type C connector.
      - **Solar Charged (Battery)**: Ideal for outdoor or eco-friendly applications.
      - **Auxiliary Port (4 - 16V)**: Provides an alternative power input for more permanent installations.

      ## Remote Management

      Beyond initial setup, these devices are equipped for remote management and updates to both device firmware and configurations can be made over the air. Configuration adjustments can be made in real time, without the need to restart the device, ensuring continuous operation. This feature is particularly valuable in dynamic environments such as automatically changing data acquisition rates remotely based on changing conditions.

      ## Diagnostics

      The devices include diagnostic capabilities to help monitor their status and troubleshoot issues:

      - **Heartbeat Messages**: Periodic signals sent by the device to indicate it's operating normally.
      - **Status Messages**: Detailed reports on the device's operational state and any potential issues.
      - **Events**: Detailed, real-time updates triggered by a change of state such as connectivity, or power disconnections, and operational issues.

      It is highly recommended to subscribe to diagnostic information for your devices so that you are notified when something is not operating as expected.

      ## Security

      Xube Devices send data securely to the Xube Platform, which includes comprehensive certificate management and rotation strategies to protect data integrity and privacy.

      ## Additional Resources

      For more technical device details, visit our [Technical Specifications](https://xube.io/docs/devices/tech-specs).

      Xube devices are designed and built to ensure high-quality performance and reliability.

      ## Device APIs and Features

      Xube offers a comprehensive range of device APIs, organized by specific functionalities to ensure ease of use. Each set of features is detailed in its respective section below, allowing you to find the relevant information quickly and apply it effectively in your operations.
  - name: Device accounts
    description: |-
      Devices are assigned to your account by the Xube team. Once assigned, you can view and manage these devices through your account using the Xube Device Accounts APIs. These APIs are useful for managing and monitoring your devices, allowing you to subscribe to updates about new additions or removals from your account.

      The Xube API includes options to fetch data for all devices linked to your account. Additionally, you can subscribe to specific notifications for each device, such as status changes, enhancing your ability to monitor and respond to different scenarios actively. To do this, first fetch or subscribe to all devices for your account and then subscribe to the device data of interest for all your account devices.

      For more details on setting up subscriptions and using webhooks for near real-time notifications, please refer to our [Webhooks documentation](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Events-and-notifications).
  - name: Device commands
    description: |-
      Device Commands enable real-time adjustments to data acquisition configurations on Xube devices. This functionality is particularly valuable for adapting the frequency of data collection from sensors in response to changes observed in your system.

      Collecting at the maximum data collection rate "just in case" you need it can become extremely expensive. This dynamic approach allows you to have full control over data collection on demand, ensuring that you gather data only as needed, saving you costs on data transfer and storage.

      ## How it works

      In order to use the device commands

      ## Example Use Cases

      - **Industrial Monitoring**: Trigger data collection from additional sensors attached to machinery machinery when abnormal vibrations or noises are detected, helping in early identification of potential failures without continuously collecting unnecessary data at high frequency.

      - **Environmental Research**: Researchers can control data collection based on environmental triggers, such as sudden changes in air quality or water levels. This precise data collection helps in studying the impact of environmental changes on local ecosystems.

      - **Manufacturing Process Control**: In manufacturing, Device Commands can modify the data acquisition settings of sensors monitoring production lines. For instance, if the production speed changes or a potential defect is detected, the system can alter the data collection rate to provide more granular insights into the manufacturing process, aiding in rapid decision-making and quality control.

      - **Smart City Applications**: In smart city infrastructure, Device Commands can optimize data collection from various sensors across the city based on specific events or conditions, such as increased pollution levels or after significant weather changes. This data can be crucial for city planners and public safety officials to make informed decisions.

      Allowing your system to send Device Commands autonomously can ensure that your data acquisition is timely, economically efficient, and tailored to the specific needs of your project or operation.
  - name: Device configuration
    description: |-
      Device configurations control how your devices operate. It is recommended that the Xube team assists with the initial configuration of your devices to ensure they are set up correctly.

      ### Scaling and System-Wide Changes

      Once familiar with the configuration process, you can efficiently scale your operations by modifying, and copying configurations from one device to multiple others. This allows for quick deployment of system-wide changes.

      ### Approval Process

      When a device is ready to have its configuration updated, approval must be granted. This can be done using the [Approve Device Config Update API](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Device-Configuration/operation/Approve%20Device%20Config%20Update).

      To check if a device is ready for an update use the [Device Configuration Update API](https://api.jez.xube.dev/docs#tag/Device-Configuration/operation/Approve%20Device%20Config%20Update).
  - name: Device engine
    description: |-
      The Device's engine runs your configurations, and manages the interface with sensors. This engine allows for configuration updates in real time, and commands to be sent to the device.

      At times, this engine might have difficulty running a configuration due to an unanticipated event and can be restart.
  - name: Device files
    description: |-
      Device configurations, drivers, and processes are stored in files. These files are stored on both the back end and the device.

      Each file can have several versions. When there is an update to a file in preparation to send it to a device, a new version is created.

      There is a set of files for each Device and there are two stages for these files:

      - **_expected_**: These files are stored in the Xube Platform
      - **_current_**: These files are stored on the Device

      Where there are expected file versions that don't match the current file versions, a configuration update for the Device is created. This configuration update must be approved before the Device is updated. For more information on updating Devices see [Device Configuration](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Device-Configuration)
  - name: Device firmware
    description: |-
      The device firmware is the software that controls how the device operates. It:

      - Controls Engine operations
      - Observers the state of the device and reports it.
      - Monitors device health and automatically resolves issues where possible.
      - Manages power and connectivity

      ### Firmware Updates

      Firmware updates increase device security and expand its functionality. When new updates become available, they are automatically prepared for devices. To initiate these updates, approval is required. This can be done using the [Accept Firmware Update API](https://api.jez.xube.dev/docs#tag/Device-firmware/operation/Accept%20Firmware%20Update).
  - name: Device heartbeats
    description: |-
      Devices periodically send heartbeats to indicate that they are responsive and accessible. Heartbeats from devices contain no data, however, they are associated with a timestamp that indicates when the heartbeat was received.

      An event will occur When the Xube Platform fails to receive a Heartbeat from devices after some time. The possibility to subscribe to this event is under development.

      ## Best Practices

      It is recommended to subscribe to the heartbeats of your devices, particularly ones that are critical for your operations.

      To ensure that the heartbeats of all the devices assigned to your account are subscribed to, follow these steps:

      - Subscribe to your Account Devices
      - When you're notified that a new Device has been assigned to your account, ensure that you also subscribe to the heartbeats for the new device.

      Also see [Device Status](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Device-status)
  - name: Device status
    description: |-
      The device status represents the devices state at a snapshot in time, including:

      - Power mode (ie. USB, Auxiliary, Solar and Battery) and the current voltages
      - Connectivity insights
      - Health information

      This status can automatically be sent to a destination you choose when there's a change in the device's state.

      It is recommended to subscribe to status updates for all devices in your account so you're notified when something changes.

      Your system can respond to undesired device states by programmatically calling the Xube APIs to quickly resolve issues and maintain system reliability.

      Welcome to the Xube API, the portal to your real-world data. The Xube API provides a bridge between your systems and the physical world. Here's everything you need to get started with our API.

      ## What is Xube?

      Xube is a real-world monitoring platform. It connects your operational systems to the physical world. Here are some ways Xube can help you monitor and interact with your sites:

      - **_Real-time Interaction_**: Interact with your site as if you were physically present, providing immediate insights into system and device health.
      - **_Data Acquisition and Management_**: Change how you collect and manage data from sensors across your projects in real time.
      - **_User and Access Management_**: Easily manage user access and permissions inside and outside to your organization. This allows you to give temporary access to someone on site, like an installer, and revoke as needed.

      ## What is the Xube API?

      The Xube API is the set of tools that allow you to manage your Xube system via RESTful requests and Webhooks.

      ## What Xube does not do

      **_Xube does not store your physical world data_**: You own your data. Xube does not function as a data storage solution. Data acquired from sensors attached to Xube devices is not used or stored in the Xube Platform. While we can temporarily replay your data under certain conditions, the responsibility to store and manage this data rests with you. The Xube Platform streams your data to the destination of your choice in real time.
  - name: Quick start guide
    description: |-
      With Xube, you can easily start monitoring and acquiring sensor data from your site. If you need help, the Xube team offers various services to help you get started including:

      - Selecting the right sensors for your needs
      - Configuring your Xube devices
      - Building or configuring your system, connecting it to the Xube Platform, and handing the keys over to you.

      ## Step 1: Create your Xube account

      Begin by signing up and creating an account for your organization to access our suite of data acquisition and monitoring solutions.

      1. **_[Sign up to Xube](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Auth/operation/Sign%20up)_:** Create your user credentials to access the API.

      2. **_[Create an account](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Accounts%20basics/operation/Create%20account)_:** Establish your account to start adding and managing devices.

      ## Step 2: Get your devices

      Once your account is ready you'll need some Xube devices to start acquiring data. Contact us at start@xube.io so we can understand your needs, regardless of whether you're launching a brand new project or adding Xube to a mature system.

      When everything is prepared, we'll send your devices out to you. When you receive your devices, simply plug them in and they're ready to go.

      ## Step 3: Prepare your system

      You need to have a destination to receive your data. This is a server, or serverless environment that can accept RESTful HTTPS requests.

      Xube offers services, and libraries to help get up and running with this. If you need some assistance, reach out to us at start@xube.io

      ## Step 2: Receive your Device Data

      Now **_[Subscribe to your data stream](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Device-Accounts/operation/Subscribe%20To%20Data%20Stream)._** Once your devices are powered, they'll start sending monitoring data and health information. You are now ready to link your system with the Xube Platform by \*\*\_ subscribing to the real time data stream from your devices. This is an essential part of receive your monitoring data and is the core API of the Xube system.

      ## Step 3: Familiarize with API Operations

      Understand how to perform essential tasks through the API by following examples and tutorials within this documentation. For example:

      - **_[List your devices](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Device-Accounts/operation/List%20Account%20Devices):_** Quickly see all devices registered to your account.
      - **_[Subscribe to a device's status](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Device-Status/operation/Subscribe%20To%20Device%20Status):_** Get notified about status changes of your device(s) to ensure their operational health.

      Navigate to the [Common APIs](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Common-APIs) section for direct links to the most used features.

      ## Best Practices

      - **Secure Your API Keys:** Always protect your credentials and ensure they are not hard-coded in your applications.
      - **Regularly Update Devices:** Keep your devices' firmware and configurations updated to maintain security and performance.
      - **Monitor Device Health:** Subscribe to your devices statuses and heartbeats to ensure you're always aware when something isn't quite right.

      ## Next Steps

      Once you’re comfortable with the basics, explore the full capabilities of the Xube platform to enhance your IoT projects. Look into more advanced features like updating device configurations, and sending commands to devices.
  - name: Events and notifications
    description: |-
      Xube brings real world data acquisition, monitoring and control to your systems. Interaction with the Xube platform requires bidirectional communication: sending configuration updates, and control commands from your system to Xube devices and receiving acquired data, events, and health metrics from these devices.

      There are two primary ways that data can be exchanged between Xube and your system:

      - Xube REST APIs (Requests): Perform specific actions or retrieve data from the Xube platform.
      - Xube Webhooks (Data Streams and Events): Stream data, and receive real-time notifications and data as events occur.

      ## Rest APIs

      The Xube REST APIs enable you to query data and issue commands to devices via HTTP requests. This method suits cases that need immediate data retrieval or device configuration changes but do not require real-time updates.

      Xube Rest APIs are extensively covered throughout this documentation so are not detailed here.

      ## Webhooks

      Webhooks are used by Xube to send events to you whenever something happens. To receive these events, you need to set destinations for the types of events your interested in. We call this a webhook subscription. Once this is done, the destination will then start receiving events.

      Webhooks are an essential part of the Xube Platform as it's how you'll receive your acquired data.

      Webhooks are available for almost every GET request in the Xube platform.

      ### Webhook subscription requests

      To subscribe a destination to webhook events send a POST request to the same path as the corresponding GET request but include the prefix `/subscribe` in the path. For example, you can fetch a Device's Status by sending a GET request to `api.xube.io/devices/{{device id}}` and you can subscribe to new Device statuses by sending a POST request with your desired destination to `api.xube.io/devices/{{device id}}/subscribe`.

      Headers can also be included in the subscription request. These headers are included in the request sent to your destination when a change occurs. It is recommended to include authentication headers in the subscription request. Webhook headers are encrypted before they are stored.

      #### Webhook subscription request structure

      The structure of a webhook subscription registration request is:

      ```json
      {
        "destination": "https://your.domain.com/your/webhook/handler/path",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Y0uR-5up3r-53cur3-T0k3n"
        }
      }
      ```

      **Note:**

      - Your destination in the subscription request **must** be an **HTTPS** url.
      - headers are optional

      ### Unsubscribing from a webhook

      To unsubscribe, simply send a DELETE request to the same url as the subscription. The destination must be included as a query parameter. For example:

      DELETE `api.xube.io/devices/{{device id}}/subscribe?destination="https://your.domain.com/your/webhook/handler/path"`

      It may take a short time for the unsubscription to take place and you may still receive webhook notifications while this is in progress.

      ### Updating a webhook subscription

      To update your destination or headers, just simply POST a new request to the same subscription url. This will overwrite the existing subscription for this path so ensure all headers that your destination needs are included.

      ### Receiving webhook events

      The Xube platform will POST events to any registered destination and include all headers for the subscription. It's important to ensure that this destination is accessible to Xube so that you can successfully receive and manage these events.

      ### Webhook limitations

      - Xube webhooks only supports **HTTPS** destinations.
      - Only one subscription can be made for a path. This means you can only subscribe once to each device's status.
      - There's no restriction on the number of headers that can be included in te request

      ### Best practices

      #### **_Include authentication headers_**

      It is highly recommended that you include an Authentication header with your subscription request to protect your system from any unauthorised requests. These Authentication headers and any other headers included in the subscription are encrypted before they are stored.

      #### **_Rotate authentication_**

      For added security its recommended that you rotate your authentication tokens in the webhook subscription headers. To do this, just perform the same subscription request but replace the authentication header with the updated authentication tokens.

      Ensure you include the destination and any headers even if you want to just change the authentication tokens, as webhook subscription registration requests overwrite any previous registration.

      ### Coming soon...

      #### High Level Subscriptions

      At the moment most of the subscriptions are high granularity which is great if you are interested in specific devices, or users, but it means that you may have to manage many webhook subscription requests just to get all the events that you're interested in. We are hoping to make it easier for those integrating with our api, by providing higher level subscription options to allow a wider catchment of changes to be sent to the same destination with a single subscription request. For example, a status update subscriptions for all devices for your account
  - name: Get API documentation
    description:
      The documentation here is accessible via api. You've effectively already
      called it if you're reading this.
  - name: Authentication
    description: |-
      Most interactions with the Xube API require authentication to ensure that requests are made securely and by verified users.

      Currently, authentication can only be performed using a valid username and password. This involves signing up, and then logging in to receive a token, which must then be used in API requests that require authentication.

      ## Obtaining a Token

      A token is necessary for interacting with most parts of the API and is obtained through a successful [login request](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Auth/operation/Log%20in).

      - **To log in:** Use the credentials with which you registered to receive an authentication token.
      - **To register:** If you do not yet have credentials, please complete the [sign up request](https://api.xube.io/docs#tag/Auth/operation/Sign%20up) to create an account.

      ## Using a Token

      To make a request that requires authentication, the token obtained during the login process must be included in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request as shown below:

      ```json
      {
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "{{token}}"
        }
      }
      ```

      ## Coming Soon

      ### **_Improved Machine to Machine Authentication_:**

      We are currently developing a method for machine-to-machine authentication that will provide a more streamlined and secure way of connecting services without manual intervention. More details will be provided as they become available.

      ## Refreshing Tokens

      It's recommended to refresh your tokens with the provided refresh token before they expire to ensure continuous access to the APIs.
